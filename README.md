# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Built With
- Java

## Description
This was a fun mini-project that I worked on! It is a program that allows the user to play tic-tac-toe, either against another human or against the computer. It focuses on employing 2D arrays, methods, user input, and input validation.

## Takeaways

This project was great for practicing modularizing my code via methods, implementing the "computer" through random selection, and maintaining game logic by constantly updating indicator variables. It was also a good way to practice data validation and ease of user input.
